# Android/Quest VR Fix - APPLIED ✅

## What Was Fixed

The original implementation used `Application.dataPath` which **does not work on Android devices** (including Meta Quest headsets). This has been fixed to use `Application.streamingAssetsPath` which works across all platforms.

## Changes Made

### 1. JSON File Location Changed ✅
- **Old Location**: `Assets/Blossom Buddy/Scripts/graph_data/`
- **New Location**: `Assets/StreamingAssets/graph_data/`
- **File Copied**: `example.json` now exists in both locations

### 2. GraphManager.cs Updated ✅
- Added `using System.Collections;` and `using UnityEngine.Networking;`
- Changed from synchronous to asynchronous loading (Coroutine)
- Added platform-specific loading:
  - **Android**: Uses `UnityWebRequest` (required for StreamingAssets on Android)
  - **Other platforms**: Uses `File.ReadAllText` (faster)
- Updated file path from `Application.dataPath` to `Application.streamingAssetsPath`

### 3. GraphJSONValidator.cs Updated ✅
- Updated file path to use `Application.streamingAssetsPath`
- Updated tooltip to reflect new location

## Why This Matters

On Android devices (Quest 2, Quest 3, Quest Pro):
- `Application.dataPath` points to the APK file (read-only, compressed)
- Files in regular `Assets` folder are not accessible at runtime
- **StreamingAssets** folder is specifically designed for runtime file access
- StreamingAssets files are copied to the device during build

## File Paths by Platform

| Platform | StreamingAssets Path |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Editor** | `Assets/StreamingAssets/graph_data/example.json` |
| **Windows** | `Application_Data/StreamingAssets/graph_data/example.json` |
| **Android** | `jar:file:///data/app/.../base.apk!/assets/graph_data/example.json` |
| **iOS** | `Application/Data/Raw/graph_data/example.json` |

Unity handles these differences automatically when using `Application.streamingAssetsPath`.

## How It Works Now

```csharp
// Old (broken on Android):
string path = Path.Combine(Application.dataPath, "Blossom Buddy", "Scripts", "graph_data", jsonFileName);
string json = File.ReadAllText(path); // ❌ Fails on Android

// New (works everywhere):
string path = Path.Combine(Application.streamingAssetsPath, "graph_data", jsonFileName);

if (Application.platform == RuntimePlatform.Android)
{
    // Android requires UnityWebRequest for StreamingAssets
    UnityWebRequest request = UnityWebRequest.Get(path);
    yield return request.SendWebRequest();
    string json = request.downloadHandler.text; // ✅ Works!
}
else
{
    // Other platforms can read directly
    string json = File.ReadAllText(path); // ✅ Works!
}
```

## Migration Steps for Your JSON Files

If you have other JSON files in the old location:

1. **Copy your JSON files** to StreamingAssets:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "Assets/StreamingAssets/graph_data"
   cp "Assets/Blossom Buddy/Scripts/graph_data/*.json" "Assets/StreamingAssets/graph_data/"
   ```

2. **No code changes needed** - GraphManager automatically uses the new location

3. **Build and deploy** to Quest - it will now work!

## Testing

### In Unity Editor:
- Works immediately (loads from `Assets/StreamingAssets/graph_data/`)

### On Quest/Android:
1. Build and deploy to device
2. Check the Unity logs (adb logcat or via Meta Quest Developer Hub)
3. Should see: `"GraphManager: Successfully loaded graph..."`

## Verification

✅ JSON file copied to StreamingAssets  
✅ GraphManager updated with coroutine loading  
✅ Platform-specific code added (Android support)  
✅ Validator updated to use new path  
✅ No linter errors  
✅ JSON file validated successfully  

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: File loading happens once at Start()
- **Asynchronous**: Uses coroutine, doesn't block main thread
- **Cached**: Data stored in memory after loading

## Additional Notes

### StreamingAssets Folder
- Files in StreamingAssets are **not processed** by Unity (raw files)
- Files are copied **as-is** to the build
- Accessible at **runtime** on all platforms
- Use for: JSON, XML, videos, audio, text files, custom data

### Build Settings
- No special build settings required
- StreamingAssets folder is automatically included in builds
- Files are compressed in the APK on Android

### File Size Considerations
- StreamingAssets files increase APK size
- `example.json` is ~5KB (negligible)
- For very large files (>10MB), consider downloading at runtime instead

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "JSON file not found"
1. Check that file exists in `Assets/StreamingAssets/graph_data/`
2. Verify filename matches exactly (case-sensitive on Android)
3. Rebuild the project (StreamingAssets must be included in build)

### Error: "Failed to parse JSON"
1. Validate JSON format (use GraphJSONValidator)
2. Check for special characters or encoding issues
3. Ensure file is UTF-8 encoded

### Error: "UnityWebRequest failed"
1. Check adb logcat for detailed error
2. Verify file was included in APK (check build logs)
3. Ensure Android permissions if accessing external storage
